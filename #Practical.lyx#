Training summary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
As we can see, in any case, the RNN doesn't really learn at all.
 This may be due to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem of Elmann's
 basic RNN network, as this network is trained on long, 100 words reviews,
 the gradient of the loss at a certain point is exponentized to the power
 of 100, leading to it either being close to 0, i.e., vanishing, or unreasonably
 large, i.e.
 exploding.
 As such, an iteration on this gradient every time won't bring us closer
 to a solution, it will only take us too much farther or leave us in the
 same place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
However, since the GRU doesn't suffer from this same problem, it learns
 effectively, and not only that, has the capability to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

remember 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 better.
 In this model, not only does the gradient with respect to the hidden state
 not vanish over time, the hidden state itself doesn't vanish either, as
 it can be integrated into each cell each time by addition.
 As such, this model has a better capability to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

remember
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the hidden state.
 Therefore, the more memory the better, and therefore the bigger the hidden
 state dimension the better, which we can see in the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Capabilities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, we saw that the results with a 128 sized hidden dimesion were
 better (with the RNN it doesn't matter much at all), so we'll use these
 models.
 We'll experiment on the accuracies of custom movie reviews that we will
 write.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
RNN:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
As we saw, the RNN doesn't learn much at all, and its capabilities are next
 to none.
 The model outputs the same probability distribution under softmax under
 shorter reviews.
 For example, the output for all of these reviews was close to [0.5273, 0.4727]:

Analysis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
First of all, we know that this model acts on individual words, only analyzing
 the full review by summing up the word's weights.
 As such, regardless of the overall sentiment of the review, if the weight
 of the positive words is larger than the weight of the negative words,
 then the model will classify the review as positive, and vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

We can see that this is why the model fails on the false positive and false
 negative.

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
In the false positive, words like

amazing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

terrific
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have large positive vectors [56.50807189941406, 0.0], [45.08697509765625,
 0.0] respectively but since the model analyzes each word individually, it
 can't tell that they're being used in a negative context.
 As such, the model classifies this review as positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series medium
In the false negative, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

horrible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a huge negative vector weight of ([0.0, 142.69271850585938], but the
 model can't tell its being used to describe what other people think, and
 what really matters is the user saying *he* 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Therefore, the model classifies this review as negative.

Though we designed this model so that it can also output negative values
 in the output vector, in the reviews that consist of fully positive or
 negative words, the output values of the words are still appropriate.
 For example, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

amazing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the TP has output [25.427003860473633, -24.959993362426758], and the word
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the TN has output [-15.516898155212402, 27.191425323486328].

We can see that the FP is now negative.
 If we look at the last three words of the review, we can see that both
 the first and second 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

s take on a negative output vector, therefore adding to the negativeness
 of the review.
 This is due to the fact that words are now dependent on their context (albeit
 that context being only 4 other words), and we can see how their weights
 changed through the following experiment:

For this experiment, we'll look at the context and output weights of the
 words in a review

Really really X
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, and see that the outputs of the first four words is dependent on on the
 word X if it is opinionated, and that the attention weights of all of the
 words all have a large weight in the word X or one of the other
